# Question: How do you simulate setTimeout and setInterval using only setTimeout? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code simulates the functionality of the built-in JavaScript functions `setTimeout` and `setInterval` using only `setTimeout`. The function `mySetTimeout` is a simple wrapper around `setTimeout`, taking a function `fn` and a delay in milliseconds, and calling `setTimeout` with these arguments. The function `mySetInterval` is more complex. It defines a helper function `interval` that calls the provided function `fn` and then schedules itself to be called again after the specified delay using `setTimeout`. This creates a loop that continues indefinitely, mimicking the behavior of `setInterval`. The code then tests these functions by scheduling messages to be logged to the console after a delay of 2 seconds and every 3 seconds, respectively.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is more complex and feature-rich than the JavaScript version. It provides more control over the timers by allowing them to be paused and resumed, which is not possible in the JavaScript version. 

In terms of language features, TypeScript introduces static types, classes, and access modifiers, which are not available in JavaScript. 

In the TypeScript version, the `Timer` class encapsulates the logic for a single timer. It stores the callback function, the delay, and the ID of the timeout (if any) as private properties. It also keeps track of the start time and the remaining time for the timer. The `pause` method stops the timer and updates the remaining time, while the `resume` method starts or restarts the timer with the remaining time.

The `Interval` class uses an instance of the `Timer` class to repeatedly execute a callback function at a specified interval. It stores the callback function and the interval as private properties, and provides `start` and `stop` methods to control the interval. The `start` method stops any existing timer and starts a new one, while the `stop` method stops the current timer.

The JavaScript version, on the other hand, uses simple functions and closures to achieve the same functionality. The `mySetTimeout` function is a simple wrapper around `setTimeout`, while the `mySetInterval` function uses a recursive `setTimeout` to simulate `setInterval`. The callback function and the delay are captured in the closure of the `interval` function, which is called repeatedly by `setTimeout`.

In conclusion, the TypeScript version provides more control and better encapsulation of the timers, but is also more complex and requires a deeper understanding of TypeScript's features. The JavaScript version is simpler and easier to understand, but provides less control over the timers.

# C++ Differences

The JavaScript version uses the built-in setTimeout function to simulate both setTimeout and setInterval. The mySetTimeout function is a simple wrapper around setTimeout, while mySetInterval uses a recursive call to setTimeout to repeatedly execute a function at a specified interval.

The C++ version, on the other hand, uses the sleep_for function from the std::this_thread namespace to pause execution of the current thread for a specified duration. This is used to simulate the delay in setTimeout and the interval in setInterval. The setTimeout function in C++ is similar to the mySetTimeout function in JavaScript, while setInterval uses an infinite loop to repeatedly call setTimeout, simulating the behavior of mySetInterval in JavaScript.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences between the languages themselves. JavaScript is single-threaded and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to use setTimeout and setInterval to schedule functions to be executed later without blocking the rest of the program. C++, on the other hand, is a multi-threaded language that uses blocking I/O, so it has to use sleep_for to pause execution of the current thread to simulate the delay or interval.

Another difference is that JavaScript uses anonymous functions (also known as lambda functions) as arguments to mySetTimeout and mySetInterval, while C++ uses std::function, which is a general-purpose polymorphic function wrapper, as arguments to setTimeout and setInterval. This allows C++ to accept any callable object, including lambda functions, as arguments to these functions.

Finally, the C++ version needs to include the necessary headers (iostream, thread, and chrono) and use the std namespace, while the JavaScript version does not need any imports or namespaces because setTimeout is a global function in JavaScript.
